# PROJECT-ROBOTICS  

*PROJECT-ROBOTICS* is a software toolkit designed for the formal analysis and design of robotic systems that incorporate artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) components.  
The project focuses on applying formal methods to perception and learning-based components, including neural networks, while modeling and analyzing system behavior in uncertain environments.  

The current version of the toolkit enables intelligent simulation guided by formal models and specifications, supporting various applications, including:  
- Temporal-logic falsification (bug detection).  
- Model-based robustness testing.  
- Parameter synthesis.  
- Counterexample analysis.  
- Dataset augmentation.  

For installation instructions, tutorials, and additional details, please refer to the documentation.
